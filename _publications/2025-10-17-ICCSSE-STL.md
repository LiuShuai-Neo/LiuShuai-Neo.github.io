In space, accurately delivering payloads enables inspection, monitoring, and debris-removal missions. Space tether systems have long been explored for momentum exchange, deorbiting, and inspection. However, existing methods have not considered using a robotic arm in a space tether system to actively accelerate and launch payloads. Also, most prior models neglect the tether mass or approximate it as massless. To close these gaps, a robotic space tether launching system with a unified modeling–control framework is established. A full nonlinear model is derived considering the tether’s mass distributions and directional tension coupling. An optimal control scheme is formulated that combines feedforward profiles with tension-feedback regulation for robustness to uncertainties and disturbances. Simulation results verify accurate targeting with specified terminal velocity, enabling propellant-free, high-precision deployment.
