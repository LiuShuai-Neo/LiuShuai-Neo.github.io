This paper details the design, manufacturing, and control of a cable-driven bionic robotic hand that closely mimics human hand movements while addressing the limitations of existing robotic hands such as high weight, size, and cost. By optimizing degrees of freedom and employing advanced fabrication methods, a solution of lightweight, cost-effective model that maintains high functionality is presented. The hand employs a cable-driven system to improve dexterity and reduce complexity, making it suitable for applications in healthcare, manufacturing, and prosthetics. The system's performance is evaluated in terms of workspace, object grasping, and free-space motion.
