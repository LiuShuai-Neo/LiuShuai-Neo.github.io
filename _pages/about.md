Welcome to my personal academic website! I am Liu Shuai, a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Duan Molong](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/molong-duan). Our Lab is [MAAL](https://maal.hkust.edu.hk/index.html). My research focuses on robotics, specifically cable-driven parallel robots, robotic manipulation, and SLAM technologies.

You can find my CV here: [Liu Shuai's CV](../files/LiuShuai_CV.pdf)

Research Interests
======
My research spans several exciting areas in robotics and automation:

**Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs)**: I specialize in the modeling, control, and optimization of cable-driven parallel robots, with particular emphasis on reconfigurable systems and disturbance rejection capabilities.

**Robotic Manipulation and Control**: I work on robotic arm modeling and control, including both traditional robotic arms and bio-inspired cable-driven robotic hands. My research covers trajectory planning, system identification, multi-finger coordination control, and real-time compensation methods.

**SLAM and Mobile Robotics**: I develop enhanced localization algorithms that integrate surface feature information into LiDAR SLAM frameworks, significantly improving positioning accuracy in complex environments for mobile robotic inspection systems.

**Additive Manufacturing and Automation**: I have experience in developing real-time monitoring and compensation systems for 3D printing using thermal imaging, achieving significant improvements in print quality and contour accuracy.
