Welcome to my personal academic website! I am Shuai Liu, a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research focuses on robotics, specifically cable-driven parallel robots, robotic manipulation, and SLAM technologies.

Research Interests
======
My research spans several exciting areas in robotics and automation:

**Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs)**: I specialize in the modeling, control, and optimization of cable-driven parallel robots, with particular emphasis on reconfigurable systems and disturbance rejection capabilities. My work includes developing mathematical models that combine dynamic and static analysis with linear elasticity theory.

**Robotic Manipulation and Control**: I work on robotic arm modeling and control, including both traditional robotic arms and bio-inspired cable-driven robotic hands. My research covers trajectory planning, multi-finger coordination control, and real-time compensation methods.

**SLAM and Mobile Robotics**: I develop enhanced localization algorithms that integrate surface feature information into LiDAR SLAM frameworks, significantly improving positioning accuracy in complex environments for mobile robotic inspection systems.

**Additive Manufacturing and Automation**: I have experience in developing real-time monitoring and compensation systems for 3D printing using thermal imaging, achieving significant improvements in print quality and contour accuracy.

Current Research Projects
======
I am currently leading several cutting-edge research projects as the principal investigator, including the modeling and control of reconfigurable cable-driven parallel robots, where I am responsible for the complete system design including drive systems, end platforms, reconfigurable anchor points, and sensor integration. I am also involved in lunar surface operation robot projects, focusing on the modeling and control of manipulator arms for mobile vehicles operating on the lunar surface.

My recent work on enhanced localization for mobile robotic inspection has resulted in the development of a composite mobile detection robot platform that integrates AGV chassis, telescopic arms, and sensor units. This system significantly improves positioning accuracy and reachability for mobile robot surface detection, particularly in high-altitude spaces.

Academic Background
======
I am pursuing my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at HKUST (2022-2026, GPA: 3.83/4.3), where I also completed my Master's degree (2021-2022, GPA: 3.93/4.3). My core coursework includes Robotics, CAD/CAM/CAE Theory and Algorithms, Topology Optimization and Additive Manufacturing, and Advanced Numerical Methods in Engineering.

Prior to my graduate studies, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Measurement and Control Technology and Instrumentation from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (2016-2020, GPA: 3.9/4.0), where I built a strong foundation in mechanical design, engineering mechanics, circuit analysis, and image processing.

Publications and Patents
======
My research has resulted in multiple high-quality publications in prestigious journals and conferences, including Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, Mechanism and Machine Theory, Additive Manufacturing, and IEEE conferences such as ROBIO and CASE. I also hold patents related to mobile robotic platforms with surface tracking capabilities for inspection applications.

Teaching Experience
======
I am passionate about education and have served as a teaching assistant for multiple courses at HKUST, including MECH 2520 Design and Manufacturing 1 and MECH 3630 Electrical Technology. Through these roles, I have developed strong communication skills and deepened my understanding of fundamental engineering principles while helping students master manufacturing, design basics, and software tools like SolidWorks.

Looking Forward
======
I am actively seeking opportunities in Shenzhen upon completion of my PhD, where I hope to continue advancing the field of robotics through innovative research and practical applications. My goal is to bridge the gap between academic research and industrial implementation, particularly in areas related to intelligent manufacturing, robotic automation, and precision engineering systems.
